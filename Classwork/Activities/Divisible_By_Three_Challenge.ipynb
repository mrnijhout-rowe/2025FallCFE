    "1. **Ask the User**: First, your program needs to ask the user how many numbers they want to check.  \n",
    "2. **Looping Through Numbers**: Using a `for` loop, you will repeatedly:  \n",
    "   * Prompt the user to enter a number.  \n",
    "   * Tell them if that number is divisible by 3 or not.  \n",
    "3. **Keep Count**: After the loop finishes, your program should display a summary:  \n",
    "   * How many numbers entered were divisible by 3\\.  \n",
    "   * How many numbers entered were NOT divisible by 3\\.\n",

    "* **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if, when you divide it by 3, there's no remainder\\! You'll want to use the **modulus (%) operator** for this. It gives you the remainder of a division. For example, `10 % 3` is `1`.  \n",
