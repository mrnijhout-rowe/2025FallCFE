    "\n",
    "Imagine you need to perform the same task multiple times, like printing 100 report cards. You could copy and paste the print command 100 times, but that would be inefficient. Loops provide a clean and powerful way to handle repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the two primary types of loops in Python:\n",
    "1.  **`for` loops**: Best for when you want to repeat a task a *specific* number of times.\n",
    "2.  **`while` loops**: Best for when you want to repeat a task *as long as* a certain condition is true."

    "A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, a string, or a range of numbers). The basic structure looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in sequence:\n",
    "    # Code to run for each item\n",
    "    # This block must be indented!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function is a very common partner for `for` loops. For example, `range(5)` creates a sequence of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 5."
